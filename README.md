## Pargeo: A Library for Parallal Algorithms in Computational Geometry

Pargeo is being developted at MIT. It hosts a growing set of multi-core implementations for parallel algorithms in computational geometry:

* Graph Generators
  * Euclidean MST
  * K-Nearest Neighbor Graph
  * Planar Beta-Skeleton
  * Planar Delaunay Graph
  * Planar Gabriel Graph
  * T-Spanner
* Spatial Query
  * K-Nearest Neighbor
  * Range Search
* Closest Pair
* 2D & 3D Z-Order Sort
* Planar Delaunay Triangulation
* Well-Separated Pair Decomposition

## Depdendencies

Pargeo runs on any modern x86-based multicore machines. To compile, it requires g++ 5.4.0 or later. The build system is [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/). 

Pargeo uses the [parlaylib](https://github.com/cmuparlay/parlaylib), a wonderful library developed at CMU for multi-core parallel programming. It and other dependencies are included in the project as submodules - initialize them before compiling the code:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Compilation

Starting from the project root directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j # this will take a while
```

## Usage

After the build completes, navigate to `<project-root>/build/executable`, where the executables are generated. Running `./<executable>` in the terminal displays short usage instructions. As an example, to compute the Euclidean MST of a point data set `<data-file>`, input the following, and the MST edges will be written to `edges.txt`.

```
./emst -o edges.txt <data-file>
```

Example data sets can be found [here](https://github.com/wangyiqiu/pargeo/tree/main/test/datasets). Pargeo automatically parses CSV-like point data files with or without header, as long as the delimiters (space, comma, etc) in between numbers are one character each in length.
